# P2P Chat Application

## Basics

### Installation

Run `make`

### Run

1. From first terminal, run `./PeerToPeerChat 5555 8888` (or any port numbers you'd like)

2. Open a new terminal, navigate to root folder of application (where Makefile is located), and run `./PeerToPeerChat 8888 5555` (or the reverse of the port numbers you ran in the first terminal window)

3. Send a message from either terminal window by typing some text (I put an arbitraty 100-char limit we can set to a higher number) and press enter. The other terminal window *should* display a notification that it received the message.
